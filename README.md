# ISO27001_RiskAssessment_Simulation-ISO 27001 Risk Assessment Simulation - Project ReadMe
Overview
This project simulates the creation of a basic ISO 27001 risk assessment and control mapping process. It includes a risk register with example information assets, associated risks, vulnerabilities, risk scoring, and control mappings to ISO 27001 Annex A controls.
Files Included
- ISO27001_Risk_Register_Template.xlsx: The main risk register with 3 example entries.
- Access_Control_Policy.docx: A sample policy document aligning with ISO 27001 controls.

How to Use
1. Review the example entries in the risk register.
2. Add more information assets relevant to your simulated or real environment.
3. Map each risk to appropriate ISO 27001 controls using Annex A as a reference.
4. Use the policy document as a base template for writing other policies (e.g., incident response, acceptable use).

Learning Objectives
- Understand how to conduct a basic information security risk assessment.
- Learn how to map real-world risks to ISO 27001 controls.
- Practice organizing security documentation suitable for audit preparation.
